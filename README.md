# CareBnB

CareBnB is a full-stack project reflecting the skills I have learned over the course of my Web Development journey. Being a solo project, CareBnB took in what I learned on the backend (databases, servers, routes) as well as the frontend (user/client side). Inspired by AirBnB, I was able to implement features such as Spots, Reviews, and Bookings. Provided below is a walkthrough of the site. Enjoy!

## Technologies

Technologies used were SQL, Sequelize, React and Redux all on VSCode.
