# CareBnB

This is a full-stack project reflecting what we have learned over the past two months. CareBnB, a solo project, is a project that took in what we learn on the backend (databases, servers, routes) as well as the frontend (user/client side). It was a difficult, but very rewarding project that I am proud to render on a live server.

## Technologies

Technologies used were SQL, Sequelize, React and Redux all on VSCode.
